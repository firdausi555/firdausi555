# Hi there, I'm Sabil Firdausi 👋

🚀I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for building innovative and efficient solutions. With almost 2 years of experience in Python, C++, and JavaScript, I’m skilled in both front-end and back-end development, leveraging frameworks like Django,React, Ruby on Rails , and Node.js to create dynamic web applications.

I have a strong background in working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, ensuring seamless data management and performance optimization. My approach is rooted in best practices, with a focus on Agile and Scrum methodologies for collaborative and timely project delivery.

I’m always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends, and I strive to write clean, maintainable code. Whether working independently or in a team, I’m committed to delivering high-quality software solutions that meet user needs and exceed expectations.
